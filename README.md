Godot 3D Modular Environment
Overview
This project is a 3D modular environment built using the Godot Engine, inspired by various YouTube tutorials. It demonstrates the implementation of modular level design, lighting, and scene composition within a structured game environment.

Features
🏗️ Modular 3D Architecture – Designed using a modular approach for flexibility and scalability.
🎨 Optimized Texturing & Materials – Applied PBR materials for realistic visuals.
💡 Dynamic Lighting – Configured real-time lighting for an immersive experience.
🏠 Interior Design – Includes detailed props like furniture, walls, and interactive objects.
Technology Stack
🎮 Engine: Godot
🖼️ Rendering: Godot’s built-in 3D renderer
🏗️ Assets: Created/customized with open-source resources
📺 Learning Reference: YouTube tutorials
Installation & Usage
Install Godot – Download the latest version of Godot Engine.
Clone the Repository – Use:
